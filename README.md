# Docker ahoi! - Workshop

## Goals

* Round 1: Docker Basics
* Round 2: Docker Compose
* Round 3: Kubernetes

## How to start?

* This repo has three branches - one branch for each round.
* Checkout branch `round 1` and follow the tasks in the `README.md` file.
* If you have solved `round 1` raise your hand.
* It is time for a recap. We will do a short summary presentation.
* We will follow this iterative process until we finished all rounds.
* Then it should be time for lunch! Yeah!
